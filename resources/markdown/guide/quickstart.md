## Quickstart

You can ship a basic integration in a day. Use this checklist to make sure the fundamentals are correct before you polish UI or scale infrastructure.

1. **Create an agent profile.** Define system instructions, optional domain context, and tools.
2. **Create a session.** Choose `webrtc` (browsers) or `websocket` (custom clients) and request credentials.
3. **Connect to realtime.** Use the `cluster_base_url` and transport URLs from the session response.
4. **Handle events.** Stream transcripts and answer tool calls.
